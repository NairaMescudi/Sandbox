# **Backtracking Algorithms Challenge**

Welcome to the **Backtracking Algorithms** category of the **100 Algorithms Challenge**! This section is designed to help you master the powerful backtracking technique, which is often used to explore all possible solutions to a problem efficiently by pruning invalid or unnecessary paths.

---

## **What is Backtracking?**

Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic approach for solving constraint-satisfaction problems. It involves:

1. Building a solution incrementally.
2. Exploring potential candidates.
3. Abandoning candidates (backtracking) as soon as they are determined to be invalid or incomplete.

## **Why Backtracking?**

Mastering backtracking helps you:
- Solve complex problems involving permutations, combinations, and constraints.
- Build solutions for real-world applications like games, optimization tools, and solvers.
- Develop a deeper understanding of recursion and constraint-based reasoning.
