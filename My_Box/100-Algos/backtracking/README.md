# Permutations

Here are 20 backtracking problems, focusing on fundamental concepts and
including problems relevant for building a CLI chess game:

## Core Backtracking Problems

- Permutations: Given an array of numbers, generate all possible permutations
of the array. 
- Subsets: Given a set of distinct integers, find all possible subsets (the
    power set). 
- Combination Sum: Find all unique combinations of numbers that sum up to a
target value. 
- Palindrome Partitioning: Partition a given string into all possible
palindromic substrings. 
- N-Queens Problem: Place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two
queens threaten each other. 
- Sudoku Solver: Solve a given partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid using
backtracking. 
- Word Search: Given a 2D board and a word, check if the word exists in the
board by moving horizontally or vertically. 
- Rat in a Maze: Given a NxN matrix with blocked and open cells, find a path
from the top-left to the bottom-right cell. 
- Generate Parentheses: Given n, generate all valid combinations of n pairs of
parentheses. 
- Combination Generation: Generate all combinations of size k from a given list
of numbers. 

## Chess-Related Backtracking Problems

- Knight's Tour: Find a sequence of moves for a knight on an N x N chessboard
such that the knight visits every square exactly once. 
- Check if a Move is Safe (Chess Piece): Write a function that checks if a move
                                         for a chess piece (e.g., queen or
                                             rook) is safe, using backtracking. 
- Generate All Legal Moves for a Piece: Given a position of a specific chess
                                         piece, generate all possible legal
                                         moves using backtracking. 
- Chess Puzzle Solver (Mate in One): Given a simplified chessboard
                                     configuration, determine if there is a
                                     move that results in checkmate in one
                                     move. 
- Place Knights on Board: Place N knights on an N x N chessboard such that no
                                     knight attacks another knight. 
- Chessboard Coloring Problem: Color the chessboard using two colors such that
                                     no two adjacent squares have the same
                                     color, using backtracking. 
- Bishop Placement Problem: Place N bishops on an N x N chessboard such that no
                                     two bishops threaten each other. 
- Eight Rooks Problem: Place 8 rooks on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two rooks
                                     can attack each other. 
- Pathfinding with Obstacles (Chess Board Variant): Given a chessboard with
                                                    obstacles, find a path from
                                                    one square to another using
                                                    backtracking. 
- Custom Piece Movement: Define a custom piece (e.g., a piece that can move
    like a knight and a rook) and use backtracking to find its path from one
                                                    square to another. 
- These problems cover fundamental backtracking techniques and also provide
                                                    useful practice for
                                                    designing logic applicable
                                                    to a chess game. Let me

                                                    solutions for any of these
                                                    problems!
