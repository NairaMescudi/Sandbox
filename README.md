# 🏖️ Sandbox: Coding Practice and Examples

Welcome to the **Sandbox Repository**! This is a comprehensive collection of my coding exercises, algorithm implementations, and small project examples. The purpose of this repository is to provide a playground for experimenting, refining problem-solving skills, and documenting my coding journey.

## 📚 Project Overview
The **Sandbox** repository is designed to serve as a personal space for:
- **Algorithm Practice**: Solutions to classic algorithm problems like sorting, searching, backtracking, and dynamic programming.
- **Data Structure Implementations**: Examples of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Project Examples**: Mini-projects and examples to demonstrate key programming concepts or explore new technologies.
- **Learning Experiments**: Code snippets and exercises for learning new programming languages, frameworks, or libraries.

## 🚀 Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:
- To serve as a **practice ground** for coding challenges and interview preparation.
- To provide **reference implementations** for common problems and patterns.
- To act as a **portfolio** showcasing my coding skills and problem-solving capabilities.
