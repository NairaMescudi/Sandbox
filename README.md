# Sandbox: Coding Practice and Examples

Welcome to the **Sandbox Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my coding practices, algorithms, and project examples. It's a space for experimenting, refining problem-solving skills, and documenting progress across various topics in software development.

## üìö Project Overview
The **Sandbox** repository is designed to be a go-to resource for:
- **Algorithm Practice**: Solutions to common algorithm problems like sorting, searching, backtracking, and dynamic programming.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Project Examples**: Mini-projects and examples that demonstrate key programming concepts or new technologies.
- **Learning Experiments**: Code snippets for learning new languages, frameworks, or libraries.

## üöÄ Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Serve as a **practice ground** for coding challenges and competitions.
- Provide **reference implementations** for common problems and patterns.
- Act as a **portfolio** of coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

Whether you're exploring new problems or revisiting familiar ones, this repository can help reinforce concepts and keep solutions organized.

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **`backtracking/`**: Contains problems and solutions using backtracking algorithms, such as permutations, combinations, and pathfinding.
- **`data_structures/`**: Implementations of fundamental data structures with example usage and explanations.
- **`dynamic_programming/`**: Solutions to classic dynamic programming problems like the knapsack problem, longest increasing subsequence, and Fibonacci sequence.
- **`projects/`**: Small-scale projects and experimental code snippets for trying out new ideas or technologies.
- **`sorting/`**: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort, with explanations of their time complexity.
- **`misc/`**: A collection of miscellaneous scripts, utilities, and interesting coding problems.

## üìñ Usage Instructions
You can explore and run any of the code examples directly from your terminal. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sandbox.git
   cd sandbox
